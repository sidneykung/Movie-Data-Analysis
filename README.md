### Phase 1 Project [Title: Movie Data Analysis]


### Intro & Contextualization

Why does this project matter? (for this business case)
(I think this can be combined the with below section)

### Overview

Summary:
What data was used to reach your findings?
* Link which datasets were included in this study

I used movie datasets from the `zippedData` folder.

* Box Office Mojo
    * bom.movie_gross
* IMDB
    * imdb.title.basics
    * imdb.title.ratings
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

Include any other key information about what you used to complete this project.
* Maybe that you used Python and its built-in library Pandas

### Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Your team is charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Methods
